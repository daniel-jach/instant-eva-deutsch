IstantEva Deutsch
================

Description
-----------

-   **InstantEva Deutsch** stands for *Instant Evaluation in German*.
-   Instant**Eva** Deutsch is an interactive online application for student course evaluations.
-   **Instant**Eva Deutsch is like instant noodles: quick, easy, and all-in-one (survey, analysis, and summary).
-   InstantEva **Deutsch** is currently only available in German.
-   Recently, the application sometimes does not load because of connectivity problems related to the COVID-19 shutdown.
