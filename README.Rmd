## Description

* **InstantEva Deutsch** stands for *Instant Evaluation in German*.
* Instant**Eva** Deutsch is an interactive online application for student course evaluations. 
* **Instant**Eva Deutsch is like instant noodles: quick, easy, and all-in-one (survey, analysis, and summary). 
* InstantEva **Deutsch** is currently only available in German. 
* Recently, the application sometimes does not load because of connectivity problems related to the COVID-19 shutdown.

A demo version of InstantEva Deutsch is available <a href='https://danieljach.shinyapps.io/instant-eva-deutsch/' target='_blank'>here</a>.
